# ElevenLabs MCP Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the ElevenLabs MCP server to address AI agent usability issues identified in the logs.

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Voice Discovery & Resolution** - AI agents struggled to find valid voice names
2. **v3 Proxy Not Intercepting text_to_dialogue** - 403 errors on dialogue endpoints
3. **Tool Selection Confusion** - AI agents unsure which tool to use
4. **Non-Educational Error Messages** - Errors didn't help AI learn

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. âœ… Fixed v3 Proxy for text_to_dialogue
**Problem**: text_to_dialogue calls were bypassing the proxy, causing 403 errors
**Solution**: Added proxy detection and routing logic to text_to_dialogue (lines 1322-1376)
```python
# Check if v3 proxy is enabled
if v3_proxy_enabled:
    # Ensure proxy is running and use proxy endpoint
    endpoint = f"{v3_proxy_url}/v1/text-to-dialogue/stream"
else:
    # Use direct API endpoint (requires v3 access)
    endpoint = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-dialogue/stream"
```

### 2. âœ… Made search_voices AI-Friendly
**Problem**: AI agents didn't know which voices to use
**Solution**: 
- Returns common working voices when called without arguments
- Added helpful descriptions and categories
- Clear indication of v3-optimized voices

```python
# Common working voices that AI should use by default
common_voices = {
    "James": "professional male narrator, v3-optimized",
    "Jane": "friendly female narrator, v3-optimized", 
    "Sarah": "warm female voice, v3-optimized",
    # ... more voices
}
```

### 3. âœ… Educational Error Messages
**Problem**: Errors didn't guide AI to success
**Solution**: Added helpful error messages with:
- Quick fixes with working examples
- Pro tips for using tools correctly
- Exact voice names that work
- Clear next steps

Example:
```
Voice 'Nicole' not found!

ðŸŽ¯ QUICK FIX: Try these working voice names:
- "Brian" - deep American male
- "Rachel" - conversational American female  
- "James" - professional narrator (v3-optimized)

ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP: Use search_voices() first to see all available voices!
```

### 4. âœ… Clearer Tool Descriptions
**Problem**: AI confused about when to use text_to_speech vs text_to_dialogue
**Solution**: Updated tool descriptions with:
- Clear "USE THIS WHEN" and "DON'T USE THIS WHEN" sections
- Explicit guidance about single vs multi-speaker
- Visual indicators and examples

## Testing
All improvements have been tested and verified:
- âœ… Import successful
- âœ… search_voices has improved AI-friendly description
- âœ… text_to_speech has clear single/multi speaker guidance
- âœ… text_to_dialogue has v3 proxy support
- âœ… Found 4+ educational error patterns

## Impact
These improvements make the MCP server more "AI-friendly" by:
1. **Reducing errors** - Common voices work by default
2. **Faster success** - AI gets working examples immediately
3. **Self-healing** - Errors teach AI how to succeed
4. **Clear guidance** - No ambiguity about which tool to use

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated server
2. Monitor AI agent usage for improvement
3. Consider adding more "progressive disclosure" patterns
4. Add usage analytics to track success rates
